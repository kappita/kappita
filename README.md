### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce myself. I'm Ignacio, a Computer Science/Informatics Engineering student at University of Santiago, Chile. I'm not a native English speaker, but I try my best. \
I've been into computers and tech since I was very young, even though I never thought I would try to live and work out of it.

I'm currently on vacations from University, so I'm working on some personal projects involving web development and some collective projects with my friends at @Guevondev, so please check them, you can find the organization in my profile.

  <summary>More about me</summary>

  ### Interests
I'd lie if a said that I'm interested in specific technologies or languages. I really enjoy creating, so, if anything gives me the chance of doing it, i'm probably loving it! That's one of the reasons I learned programming in the first place.

### Details about what I know

- B2 English (Or a little bit higher). At my second year of University I did an interview to check my English level, managing to skip all English classes (From English I to English IV)
- Python programming experience. Currently planning on giving assistantship at my University to new students having their first interactions with the language.
- C programming experience. Learned C alonside Data Structures at my University.
- I had some interactions with the Java programming language for an University class, so I'm not new to it, but I haven't worked enough with it to say that I have experience.



  

<sub>I really want to keep expanding this section, as I really love learning, so expect to see new things in here every now and then.<sub>
